INTRO CHAT BLURB:
Hi, my name's Keith Ratliff and I'm an instructor in the training team at Snowflake.
We're a part of the Professional Services and Training organization, helping our
customers get up, get running, and be effective at using Snowflake to solve your use cases.
I was previously in PS&T at a Hadoop company (Cloudera) for 6 years,
worked in the eBay Marketplace operations center for 6 years,
and had a long run in PS&T at Sun Microsystems.
You can find me on LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-keith-ratliff/
In my spare time, I collect and read comic books, and I've been lucky to pick up a few rare gems.
